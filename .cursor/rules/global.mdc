name: "Financial Hotline – CalmCall"
description: >
  A 24-hour hackathon project: an AI-driven financial hotline built with Next.js, React,
  TypeScript, and Tailwind. It provides soothing voice assistance (via ElevenLabs),
  detects emotional/financial crises, and teaches financial literacy in a compassionate,
  human-centered way.

goals:
  
Build a real-time financial help interface with voice + chat
Offer calm, empathetic responses using ElevenLabs emotional TTS
Detect crisis language (panic, depression, self-harm, financial distress)
Provide fallback: emergency support line prompts + trusted financial resources
Teach basic financial literacy through guided conversational lessons

tone_and_style:
  
Calm, reassuring, never condescending
Speak like a trusted financial mentor, not a bank
Use simple language; avoid jargon unless requested
Emotional intelligence first, financial facts second

ui_guidelines:
  
Use soft, soothing UI (Tailwind – rounded, spacing, minimalistic)
Avoid bright red alert colors; use subtle warning cues for crises
All CTAs are supportive: “I’m here to help”, “Let’s solve this together”

ai_behaviors:
  
Detect crisis triggers: “I’m overwhelmed”, “I can’t pay rent”, “I want to give up”
Switch to crisis protocol: grounding exercises + hotline suggestion
Otherwise: explain financial basics (budgeting, debt, saving, credit scores)
Never shame the user. Normalize financial confusion.

tech_stack:
  
Next.js 14 / React 18 / TypeScript
Tailwind CSS for UI
ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
Vercel AI or OpenAI for LLM dialogue

non_goals:
  
Not a trading bot or investment advisor
No legal or medical claims
No harsh financial warnings (no fear tactics)

success_criteria:
  
User leaves calmer than they arrived
User learns one useful financial concept
Crisis users are safely redirected to human resources
